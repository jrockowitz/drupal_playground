# Drupal Playground Elasticsearch

Sets up a simple Elasticsearch-backed Search API demo for Drupal content in Drupal Playground, including Views-based autocomplete suggestions and spellcheck.

## What It Installs

### Modules

- [Search API](https://www.drupal.org/project/search_api)
- [Elasticsearch Connector](https://www.drupal.org/project/elasticsearch_connector)
- [Facets](https://www.drupal.org/project/facets)
- `facets_exposed_filters` from [Facets](https://www.drupal.org/project/facets)
- [Better Exposed Filters](https://www.drupal.org/project/better_exposed_filters)
- [Views Autocomplete Filters](https://www.drupal.org/project/views_autocomplete_filters)
- [Search API Spellcheck](https://www.drupal.org/project/search_api_spellcheck)
- [Views Exposed Filters Summary](https://www.drupal.org/project/views_filters_summary)
- `views_filters_summary_search_api` from [Views Exposed Filters Summary](https://www.drupal.org/project/views_filters_summary)
- [Views Ajax History](https://www.drupal.org/project/views_ajax_history)

### Configuration

- A Search API server pointed at the local DDEV Elasticsearch service
- A Search API index for `article` nodes
- A simple Views search page at `/elasticsearch`
- Autocomplete suggestions on the `/elasticsearch` keyword field
- A `Did you mean:` spellcheck prompt on the `/elasticsearch` results page
- A header summary of the active exposed filters on `/elasticsearch`
- AJAX search state that updates the browser URL and back/forward history

### Default Content

- An `Elasticsearch` shortcut that links to `/elasticsearch`
- Ten default-content demo articles stored in the recipe
- One custom square plush illustration for each demo article

## Local DDEV Elasticsearch

This recipe expects a local Elasticsearch service in DDEV at `http://elasticsearch:9200`.

This repository commits the DDEV service files directly so the local setup is version-controlled.

If you are adding Elasticsearch to a different DDEV project from scratch, the reference add-on command is:

```shell
ddev add-on get ddev/ddev-elasticsearch
```

In this repository you do not need to run that add-on command because the Elasticsearch service files are already committed. The local setup flow for this project is:

```shell
ddev start
ddev describe
```

After `ddev start`, confirm the `elasticsearch` service is listed as `OK` and exposed at `http://drupal-playground.ddev.site:9200`.

## Installation

```shell
# Install Drupal and apply the Elasticsearch preset.
ddev install elastic
```

## Indexing

Run indexing after applying the recipe so the recipe-provided demo articles appear in search results:

```shell
ddev drush search-api:index drupal_playground_elasticsearch
```

## Autocomplete

This recipe includes `drupal/views_autocomplete_filters:^2.0`.

The current Elasticsearch Connector backend in this project supports Search API spellcheck, but this recipe no longer depends on backend-native Search API autocomplete support.

Instead, the recipe configures the exposed `Search` fulltext filter on the `/elasticsearch` View to use Views Autocomplete Filters and source its suggestions from a hidden indexed `Title` field already present in the Search API index.

That gives the `/elasticsearch` keyword field title-based autocomplete suggestions while keeping the submitted query mapped to the existing fulltext `keys` filter.

## Spellcheck

This recipe includes `drupal/search_api_spellcheck:^4.0`.

The demo content search view adds the `Search API Spellcheck "Did You Mean"` header plugin so misspelled queries can suggest a corrected search. In this recipe the spellcheck prompt is configured to:

- show a single best correction
- hide itself when the search already has results
- use collation when available from the backend

## Exposed Filter Summary

This recipe includes `drupal/views_filters_summary:^3.4`.

Because the Elasticsearch demo page is backed by a Search API index, the recipe also enables the bundled `views_filters_summary_search_api` submodule so the selected fulltext and Search API filter values are summarized correctly.

The demo content search view replaces the plain result-count header with a Views Exposed Filters Summary header configured to:

- display the result count
- summarize the `Search` and `Tags` exposed filters
- show filter labels
- avoid per-filter remove links
- keep the summary compatible with the AJAX search page

## AJAX History

This recipe includes `drupal/views_ajax_history:^1.8`.

The demo content search view already uses AJAX for filtering and paging. This module adds browser history support to that AJAX behavior so users can:

- share the current filtered search URL
- use the browser back button after changing filters or paging results
- use the browser forward button to return to a later AJAX search state

The recipe enables the `ajax_history` display extender on the demo content search view.

## Facets

This recipe includes `drupal/facets:^3.0` and uses the `facets_exposed_filters` submodule to turn the `Tags` filter on `/elasticsearch` into a real tag facet.

The Elasticsearch recipe installs the needed search UI modules for this feature:

- `facets`
- `facets_exposed_filters`
- `better_exposed_filters`

The underlying Composer package used for this setup is:

```shell
composer require 'drupal/facets:^3.0'
```

Facets 3 is the recommended approach for new Search API and Views integrations. In this recipe, the `Tags` filter is implemented as a **Facets 3 exposed filter** inside the search view rather than as a separate facet block.

The facet source for this setup is the existing search page display:

- `search_api:views_page__drupal_playground_elasticsearch__page_1`

The facet target is the indexed tags field in the `drupal_playground_elasticsearch` Search API index.

Current behavior:

- keyword search remains in place
- keyword search supports autocomplete suggestions
- misspelled keywords can show a spellcheck correction
- the header summarizes the active search and tag filters
- AJAX filter and pager changes update browser history
- the `Tags` filter is a choice-based tags facet
- Search API relevance remains the default sort

The `ddev install elastic` preset clears the Search API index before reindexing content so Elasticsearch field mappings stay in sync with the recipe configuration.

## Verification

Check the Search API server status:

```shell
ddev drush search-api:server-status drupal_playground_elasticsearch
```

Visit the search page:

```shell
ddev launch /elasticsearch
```

Or use the one-time login URL after `ddev install elastic` and browse to:

- `/elasticsearch`

The recipe ships ten `article` nodes as default content:

- Elasticsearch
- Drupal Search API
- Elasticsearch connector for Drupal & DDEV
- Search relevance in Drupal with Elasticsearch
- How indexing works in Drupal Search API
- Running Elasticsearch locally with DDEV
- Building a Views-based search page with Search API
- When to use the Elasticsearch connector module
- Debugging failed indexing in a local Drupal search setup
- Autocomplete, facets, and spellcheck in Drupal search

The recipe also ships one shortcut in the default shortcut set:

- Elasticsearch

The current search page uses exposed filters for:

- `Search`
- `Tags`

The `Tags` filter is implemented as a Facets 3 exposed filter rather than a separate facet block.

## Scope

This first version intentionally keeps the setup small:

- indexes only `article` nodes
- uses a standard no-auth local Elasticsearch connection
- provides a minimal Views-backed search page

Out of scope for v1:

- production authentication or hardening
